This 2013 has been a year full of changes for me.

I didn't intend to have this intense of a year, but seems that life (or luck?)
sometimes can give us more than we could imagine.

This is a list of the remarkable things that I did and/or happened to me:

- Started the year with a relationship with
[Beatrice](http://www.beatricemurchphotography.com/).
It was an amazing way to start the year, and today is our first anniversary.
Things moved fast but smoothly.

- Became a vegetarian. I wanted to find out for myself how hard it is to live
without eating meat. It is not as hard as I imagined it to be, but when
you go to an [asado](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sanbor/3224732502/) it can be
a quite challenging to skip the main dish. After 358 days, yesterday I ate
meat again and the experience was a little odd and gave me more to think about.
I'm considering to be more flexible next year.

- Travelled outside of Argentina for the first time. Spending our two week
vacation in an amazing cabin in Punta del Diablo, Uruguay. It was a great way
to get to know my partner better and make our love grow.

- Changed jobs from [Despegar.com](http://www.despegar.com.ar/) to
[55Social](http://www.55social.com/) hoping to learn new skills
and experience different challenges. The team I worked with in Despegar was
great, but I didn't feel challenged in my position and I felt lost is such a big
company. In 55Social I found a work environment more familiar to what I was used
to and also was able to learn new things.

- Started, for the third time, my Computer Engineering degree; this time in
[UADE](http://www.uade.edu.ar). I just finished my first year without having to
re-take any classes.
So next year, I will be able to take all my classes for my sophomore year
(2nd year). I still have some finals to take in February.

- First time in the USA, specifically in California. Second time outside the
country.

  While I didn't find big differences between Argentina and Uruguay, the
  United States were completely different.

  It was an incredible experience, I met a lot of interesting people and
  loved the different landscapes and climates of California. Also,
  Beatrice took me to visit some tech companies you may have heard about:
  Google, Pixar and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), so it was
  wonderful to see how they work there. 

- First time getting fired from a job. Both my employer and I were doing our
best to make things work, but our expectations never matched up. So, while I
was thinking about searching for a different job, they fired me. Unexpectedly,
it turned out very well for me (I hope for them too).

  It was a new and challenging experience. At first, it was hard because I felt
  like I failed. But, after some reflection, I came to find that sometimes
  things don't work out as we want, even doing our best. So is ok to try new
  things and fail, you just have to keep on trying.

- First time working part-time (6 hours) with a friend at
[Creativa 77](http://www.creativa77.com.ar).
I started working again only two-weeks after being fired. I'm still tending to
work a little more than 6 hours per day because I feel that is not enough, but having
2 hours more each day lets me study more and have more energy.
I'm very thankful to be working with a friend and that he holds
accountable for my studies.

- First Christmas eve without my family. Just a special dinner out with
Beatrice to celebrate our anniversary. All my family had plans, so we tried
something different this year. It was a lovely dinner with some blackouts
because the heat.
