This is a little update of my life about how I'm doing.

The first week of 2014 (this is from Monday 7th to Sunday 12th) it was pretty
tuff. I worked hard in my job and didn't get good results. And worst,
I almost didn't study.

This week I'm doing better, I learned from my last week errors and I
started studying more often (not so productive as I would like but at least I'm
doing some progress).

I just read two days ago a [very interesting post](http://austinkleon.com/2013/12/29/something-small-every-day/)
about focusing on days.

Here is an excerpt of the post:

> It takes time to do anything worthwhile, but thankfully, we don’t need it all
> in one chunk. So this year,
> forget about the year as a whole. Forget about months and forget about weeks.

> Focus on *days*.

> The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my head around. Seasons
> change, weeks are completely human-made, but the day has a rhythm. The sun
> goes up; the sun goes down. I can handle that.

The post mentions a Jerry Seinfeld productivity tip: get a calendar and mark a
red cross each day that you do your daily goal. Then you just have to keep a
chain of red crosses.

My [current goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014-goals.html) are studying, improving
my English, blogging and floss, among other things.

After reading the post I print a [very basic calendar](http://www.calendarlabs.com/printable-calendar1.php?utm_expid=12657909-5.LeHNbDG4QY-ATXCW6as7yw.1)
and put it on the wall. And today after studying for my exams and practicing
English I finally drew my first red cross in the calendar.


## Next week

I was looking for more challenges in my work and become a better student. As
a friend of mine says, be careful with what you wish because it can become true.

I have to do a lot of work for the next two weeks and I have to really focus on
my studies if I want to pass the exams, so the next two weeks are really
important for me, I have to focus and do a lot of effort to do both work and
studies well.

This week I was feeling pretty tired after work, so (as Austin suggests) the
first thing that I will do in the morning is studying, in order to just relax at
the end of the day.

Let’s see how things turn.
